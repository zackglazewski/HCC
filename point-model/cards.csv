Abomination,,Human,,,,,,,,,,,Background,"Formerly known as Emil Blonsky, a spy of Soviet Yugoslavian origin working for the KGB, the Abomination gained his powers after receiving a dose of gamma radiation similar to that which transformed Bruce Banner into the incredible Hulk.

While he was able to maintain his normal level of self-control and intelligence after this transformation, he is unable to return to human form.",Rivalry with the Hulk,"Given his gamma-spawned origins, Blonsky blames his condition on Banner and his alter ego, the Hulk. The Abomination and the Hulk have clashed on numerous occasions, with Blonsky perpetually playing the role of the aggressor. Although Blonsky occasionally gains the upper hand in their battles, the Hulk manages to triumph in the end. But not always; the Abomination is one of the few who can lay claim to victory over the green-skinned goliath.",Hatred for Banner,"In recent years, it was revealed that his hideous new visage had served to alienate Blonsky from his ex-wife, Nadia. Coupled with constant defeats at the hands of the Hulk, this has driven Blonsky nearly insane in his hatred for Banner. The Abomination also grew incensed upon learning that Banner had married Betty Ross, the daughter of General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross. With the loss of his wife, Blonsky figured it is only fair to him that Banner should lose Betty. Out of jealousy, he caused the apparent death of Bruce Banner's wife Betty. While she was recovering from radiation sickness caused by exposure to the gamma radiation within Banner, he poisoned her with his radioactive blood, causing Banner and his associates to believe that her close proximity to the Hulk had given her a fatal case of radiation poisoning. Banner later exposed the Abomination's role in Betty's seeming death, and defeated him in combat.",Crushing Defeat,"Not only had his grand scheme failed, but Banner also forgave Blonsky. The Abomination could not comprehend and endure his enemy's absolution, and his moment of triumph was twisted into crushing defeat. Blonsky realized he had become what he abhorred the most - it was he who was the rampaging, inhuman monster; not the Hulk as he had religiously believed all these years.",,custom-grishnakh-custom-figure-text-abomination.png

After various encounters with Earth's Green Lantern Hal Jordan, he was imprisoned within the Central Power Battery. There he was able to use his ring, which uses fear, as opposed to willpower, as a power source, to awaken Parallax from hibernation.

Qward now has a huge yellow ""Central Battery"" on it, like the one used on Oa. Arkillo, a large and muscular vicious alien is enslaving all the Weaponers of Qward and forcing them to continuously build new yellow rings, programmed to breach the barrier between anti-matter and matter universe and find and recruit new ring-wielders.

Known members, other than the Corps' namesake and Arkillo, include Karu-Sil, raised by animals; Despotellis, a sentient virus capable of attacking Lanterns from the inside; Bedovian, the sniper of the Corps, capable of taking out a target from three sectors away while living off of the fungus growing on his ""hermit crab"" like shell. Recently, the Sinestro Corps attempted to recruit Batman, known even to some alien races for his great formidability and ability of instilling great fear in others. However, Batman's willpower combined with his previous brief exposure to a power ring allowed him to reject the yellow ring before it took him to be properly trained and molded into one of Sinestro's warriors.

Mindless figures and Machines cannot be mind controlled.

If a controlled figure is moved into a space, or takes an action, that would potentially cause that figure harm on that turn, it gets a chance to avoid taking the action. (This includes moving into Lava, jumping off of buildings, destroying an adjacent ITF that explodes, hitting a character with counter strike, etc.) To avoid completing the harmful move or action the player that originally owns the controlled figure rolls the 20-sided die. If a Hero figure rolls a 6 or higher it automatically breaks the control and the chosen figure returns to the player who controlled the figure before being controlled. A single squad figure, or a Dimwitted figure, needs to roll a 12 or higher to break the control.",,,,,,,,custom-grishnakh-custom-figure-text-poison-ivy.png
