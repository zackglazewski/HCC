Abomination,,Human,,,,,,,,,,,Background,"Formerly known as Emil Blonsky, a spy of Soviet Yugoslavian origin working for the KGB, the Abomination gained his powers after receiving a dose of gamma radiation similar to that which transformed Bruce Banner into the incredible Hulk.

While he was able to maintain his normal level of self-control and intelligence after this transformation, he is unable to return to human form.",Rivalry with the Hulk,"Given his gamma-spawned origins, Blonsky blames his condition on Banner and his alter ego, the Hulk. The Abomination and the Hulk have clashed on numerous occasions, with Blonsky perpetually playing the role of the aggressor. Although Blonsky occasionally gains the upper hand in their battles, the Hulk manages to triumph in the end. But not always; the Abomination is one of the few who can lay claim to victory over the green-skinned goliath.",Hatred for Banner,"In recent years, it was revealed that his hideous new visage had served to alienate Blonsky from his ex-wife, Nadia. Coupled with constant defeats at the hands of the Hulk, this has driven Blonsky nearly insane in his hatred for Banner. The Abomination also grew incensed upon learning that Banner had married Betty Ross, the daughter of General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross. With the loss of his wife, Blonsky figured it is only fair to him that Banner should lose Betty. Out of jealousy, he caused the apparent death of Bruce Banner's wife Betty. While she was recovering from radiation sickness caused by exposure to the gamma radiation within Banner, he poisoned her with his radioactive blood, causing Banner and his associates to believe that her close proximity to the Hulk had given her a fatal case of radiation poisoning. Banner later exposed the Abomination's role in Betty's seeming death, and defeated him in combat.",Crushing Defeat,"Not only had his grand scheme failed, but Banner also forgave Blonsky. The Abomination could not comprehend and endure his enemy's absolution, and his moment of triumph was twisted into crushing defeat. Blonsky realized he had become what he abhorred the most - it was he who was the rampaging, inhuman monster; not the Hulk as he had religiously believed all these years.",,custom-grishnakh-custom-figure-text-abomination.png

After various encounters with Earth's Green Lantern Hal Jordan, he was imprisoned within the Central Power Battery. There he was able to use his ring, which uses fear, as opposed to willpower, as a power source, to awaken Parallax from hibernation.

Qward now has a huge yellow ""Central Battery"" on it, like the one used on Oa.

Known members, other than the Corps' namesake and Arkillo, include Karu-Sil, raised by animals; Despotellis, a sentient virus capable of attacking Lanterns from the inside; Bedovian, the sniper of the Corps, capable of taking out a target from three sectors away while living off of the fungus growing on his ""hermit crab"" like shell. Recently, the Sinestro Corps attempted to recruit Batman, known even to some alien races for his great formidability and ability of instilling great fear in others. However, Batman's willpower combined with his previous brief exposure to a power ring allowed him to reject the yellow ring before it took him to be properly trained and molded into one of Sinestro's warriors.

(This includes moving into Lava, jumping off of buildings, destroying an adjacent ITF that explodes, hitting a character with counter strike, etc.) To avoid completing the harmful move or action the player that originally owns the controlled figure rolls the 20-sided die. If a Hero figure rolls a 6 or higher it automatically breaks the control and the chosen figure returns to the player who controlled the figure before being controlled. A single squad figure, or a Dimwitted figure, needs to roll a 12 or higher to break the control.",,,,,,,,custom-grishnakh-custom-figure-text-poison-ivy.png

Without masters to command them the Moloids wandered into what is now commonly referred to as Subterranea. Over the centuries the Moloids lost much of their intelligence and strength due to massive inbreeding and these creatures would become loyal to whomever they deemed to be most powerful.

He became an intergalactic criminal with a deep hatred for the Green Lantern Corps. He became head of the Black Circle Crime Syndicate but a battle with Kyle Rayner culminated in Sur's decapitation. Amon returned, his head fully regrown due to his species' regenerative abilities. This time targeting Hal Jordan, attempting to reclaim Abin Sur's ring, Amon traveled to Earth where he had hired a group of bounty hunters to capture Hal Jordan. While the bounty hunters attacked Hal Jordan, Amon traveled to Edwards Air Force Base where they were keeping his father's ship. Taking the ship and the remains of a destroyed Manhunter, Amon went to the desert where Abin Sur was buried. Hal Jordan was there, having been captured by one of the bounty hunters, Hunger Dog. Amon drained the Jordan's power ring with the Manhunter skull, but could still not remove the ring from Hal's finger. Sur then forced Hal to bring him to the corpse of Abin Sur. When they arrived, Amon had all of his father's belongings back, except the ring, which he now believed would go to him once Hal was dead. Hal mocked Amon, stating that he was not fearless. He feared to kill him. Amon grew furious and pulled the trigger of his weapon. However, Hunger Dog blocked the attack and was revealed to be John Stewart in disguise. The two Green Lanterns ganged up on Amon who engaged in a fist fight with Jordan. In the middle of the fight, a small yellow ring arrived on the battlefield, in front of Amon, stating he could instill great fear and was welcomed to the Sinestro Corps. Amon took the ring and tried to use it against Hal and John. His attempt was interrupted, however, when the ring immediately transported him to Qward. Representing Sector 2814, Amon became a member of the Sinestro Corps, an Corps of beings with the goal to spread fear throughout the galaxy. When the Sinestro Corps kidnapped Kyle Rayner on Qward, Amon was one of the Sinestro Corps members who fought him, still angry over Kyle defeating him the first time they met. Amon was present during the Green Lantern Corps mission to rescue the Ion entity on Qward. Alongside, the new Parallax, Amon fought Hal Jordan. After the Green Lantern squad fled into the catacombs of Qward, Amon led a platoon of Sinestro Corps members to follow them, only to be ambushed by Hal Jordan, wielding many Qwardian power rings. When the Sinestro Corps invaded Earth, Amon was part of the strike force Sinestro led above Coast City. Hal Jordan, Kyle Rayner, and many other Green Lanterns fought them high above the city. Unknown to Amon, the Green Lanterns could now use Lethal Force and seeing this, he fled the battle in fear.",,,,,,custom-grishnakh-custom-figure-text-amon-sur.png

He would soon learn that there were another 3599 Green Lanterns across the universe, all monitored and empowered by mystical creatures called the Guardians. Hal received training from some of the best the Corps had to offer, including drill sergeant Kilowog, and his mentor Sinestro. During his training, Hal learned that Sinestro has been subjugating his home planet, Korugar, through fear, using his ring. After Hal reported these acts to the Guardians and fellow Corps members, he battled Sinestro, and emerged victorious. Along with the rest of the Corps, he then testified against Sinestro at his trial. Expelled from the Corps and banished by the Guardians to the Antimatter Universe as punishment, Sinestro became a sworn enemy to the Corps and gained a new Qward power ring, exacting the start of his revenge.",Life as Green Lantern,"As Green Lantern, Hal Jordan patrolled the galaxy and took on many missions in space.

His dedication to preserving order originally manifested in his previous career, an anthropologist specializing in reconstructions of ruins of long-dead civilizations. One day while he was on one such site, a Green Lantern named Prohl Gosgotha crash-landed into the site, injured and apparently dying. He quickly gave his ring to Sinestro, just in time for Sinestro, who barely even understood what the ring could do, to defend himself from the Lantern's pursuer: a Weaponer of Qward; however, Sinestro had to destroy the ruins he had spent time restoring in order to crush the Qwardian. Afterward, Gosgotha turned out to still be alive and asked for his ring back to keep him alive long enough to get help. Sinestro, knowing this would mean not being a Green Lantern himself, instead allowed him to die and took over his post. The Guardians were unaware of his actions.",Rise and Fall,"His desire for order did well by him in the Corps, and initially led him to be considered one of the greatest Green Lanterns. As the years passed, he became more and more fixated upon not simply protecting his sector, but on preserving order in the society of his home planet no matter the cost. Eventually, he concluded that the best way to accomplish this was to conquer Korugar and rule the planet as a dictator.",Mentor to Hal Jordan,"When Hal Jordan joined the Green Lantern Corps, Sinestro was assigned to be his instructor. Jordan was horrified at his new mentor's totalitarian methods, though Sinestro maintained that his iron-fisted rule was necessary to protect his people from alien forces. During his training, Jordan helped Sinestro repel an attempted invasion of Korugar by the alien warlords known as the Khunds. When Jordan called for help from the other Green Lanterns, Sinestro's dictatorship was exposed and he was forced to appear before the Guardians for punishment.",Exile to Qward,"For using the power of the Green Lantern to instill fear rather than combat it, the Guardians banished Sinestro to the antimatter universe, a counterpart to the ""real"" universe made up of ""negative matter"". Sinestro ended up on the Antimatter world of Qward, that universe's counterpart of the Guardians' homeworld Oa, which was ruled by a race of warriors and scientists known as the Weaponers of Qward, who bore a fierce hatred of the Guardians and all Green Lanterns. By exiling Sinestro to a world ruled by evil beings who specifically hated him as a Green Lantern, the Guardians hoped to humble him. However, their attempt at punishment would be a major miscalculation. Sinestro believed himself to have been wronged by his former masters and now hated them just as much as the Weaponers did. Through their mutual hatred of the Guardians, Sinestro and the Weaponers became allies, with the Weaponers offering to help Sinestro gain revenge on the Guardians and the Corps.",,custom-grishnakh-custom-figure-text-yellow-lantern-sinestro.png
